# LeafSpeciesDetection_DecisionTree
Leaf species detection using decision trees is a method of classifying leaves into different species based on their characteristics using a decision tree algorithm. In the context of leaf species detection, decision trees can be trained on a dataset of labeled leaf samples, where each leaf sample is associated with a specific species label.
